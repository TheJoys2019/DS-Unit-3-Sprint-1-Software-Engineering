### Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

Acme Corporation isn't just a few `.py` files. If you want to grow in your
career here, you'll have to answer the following:

- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
  ### Code reviews are very important in the real world. They allow the ability to test out bugs that may cause big problems.It is also a great way to have your peers review y our work and critique you good or bad. Code review's provide ways to establish uniformity throughout the entirety of your code if you work for a company that has a certain guideline for how they'd like their code format to be. Having someone code review so you meet the guidelines of the company format are a great way to keep your code clean and by standards.


- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

### Containers can help, in theory, run the same program properly on all the computers, if it can be run on one isolated 'container' platform. Containers provide flexibility in specific case jobs, for example lets assume the ACME data scientists are trying to make visualizations only and are working with a custom container that has prepackaged libraries specific for completing the task already installed like matplotlib or seaborn inside of it, it saves time and computing power by using this method. Containers are great platforms for testing out codes that would like to be projected into the mainstream, you can test your program on multiple OS containers and correct any issues you may encounter.
